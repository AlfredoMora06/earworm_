# Earworm

A MERN full-stack web application for music discovery, research and analysis.

Earworm is a music data visualization and music exploration tool based on the Billboard 200 Year-End charts from 1970-2020. Using these charts, Earworm provides an overview of the albums on every chart year as well as data visualization to offer insights on the way music trends change and develop over time.

The homepage displays a single year's Billboard 200 Chart, as well as some fast facts about that chart year (like most popular genre, #1 artist, and album with the most Grammy awards), a genre breakdown of the top 100 albums, and the oldest album on that chart year.
